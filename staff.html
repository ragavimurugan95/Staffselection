             The process begins with creating and posting job advertisements to attract potential candidates.
             Applications and resumes are reviewed to shortlist candidates who meet the basic qualifications.
             Shortlisted candidates are contacted for an initial interview, often conducted over the phone or via video call.
             Candidates may be required to complete various tests to evaluate their skills, knowledge, and suitability for the role.
             Selected candidates are invited for in-person interviews to assess their fit with the company culture and job requirements.
             Background checks are conducted to verify the candidateâ€™s employment history, education, and any other relevant information.
             References provided by the candidate are contacted to gather additional insights into their qualifications and work ethic.
             The final candidate is offered the job, and negotiations regarding salary and other terms may take place.<hr>
